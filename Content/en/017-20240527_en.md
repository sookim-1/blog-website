### 📗 Summary of Work

---

I summarized and organized my work at the company in more detail from May 2022 to the present.

I noticed that initially, I focused on collaboration tools and development culture. After understanding the domain, I balanced fixing new features and issues while also engaging in refactoring during my spare time.

### 📅 FSCalendar

---

Since I planned to use the FSCalendar library, I realized I needed to understand the methods of the `FSCalendarDelegate`, so I tried various customizations through hands-on experimentation.

FSCalendar is a straightforward library to use once you are aware of a few key considerations.

I decided to compile the frequently used methods and posted example code on my blog.

### 🙋🏻‍♂️ Other Notes

---

1. I conducted a refactoring of the GeekReport side project (partially applying Clean Architecture + MVVM and introducing Tuist). I also updated the ReadMe, completing the first phase of the refactoring.
2. I experienced firsthand that changing from `UICollectionViewFlowLayout` to `UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout` reduces the number of code lines and improves readability.
