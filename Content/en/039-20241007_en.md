### 🚨 iOS 18 and Xcode 16 Compatibility

---

To use Xcode 16, you must update your macOS to Sequoia 15.0.

Additionally, when using macOS Sequoia, Xcode 15 cannot be officially launched. (As a workaround, you can run Xcode 15 by going to the Xcode app → Show Package Contents → Contents → MacOS → and executing the Unix file named Xcode.)

Xcode 16 introduces several issues related to CocoaPods, and as Kakao SDK is progressively transitioning to SwiftPM, it seems that migrating to SwiftPM offers another advantage.

In iOS 18, new properties were added to `UITabBarController`, and I observed that the lifecycle methods of the embedded ViewControllers are invoked in a different order when switching between tabs.

Additionally, if `dequeue` is called more than twice on a `CollectionViewCell`, the app now crashes. Always be cautious when updating to a new OS version.

### 📂 Building UnitTest and UITest Targets in Tuist

---

When managing a project with Tuist, setting up a UnitTest target requires the Provisioning Profile in Signing settings to be set to "None Required."

To resolve this, you can set the Code Signing Entitlements to an empty value and add the target you want to specify for UnitTest as an argument in the `dependencies`.

For the UITest target, the setup is similar, but the Provisioning Profile in the Signing settings should be set to "Xcode Managed Profile." The key difference from UnitTest is that you must also add the UITest target and any libraries it depends on to the `dependencies` to ensure successful builds.

### 🙋🏻‍♂️ Other Notes

---

1. I have reviewed the concepts of TCP, UDP Sockets, and WebSockets. I plan to organize this further and implement them directly in Swift.
