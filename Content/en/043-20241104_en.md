### 🌎 Development of the Socket Cluster Native Open-Source Library

---

I developed my second open-source library.

The goal was to improve the [socketcluster-client-swift](https://github.com/sacOO7/socketcluster-client-swift) library, which assists in socket communication.

The original library has not been updated for four years, lacks support for ping and pong functions, and poses potential risks for continued use.

> Key Improvements
> 

1. Removed dependencies on Starscream, HandyJSON, Quick, Nimble, and RxSwift, leveraging Apple frameworks instead.
    - [Starscream](https://github.com/daltoniam/Starscream) → [URLSessionWebSocketTask](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsessionwebsockettask**)
    - [HandyJSON](https://github.com/alibaba/HandyJSON) → [Codable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/codable)
    - [Quick](https://github.com/Quick/Quick), [Nimble](https://github.com/Quick/Nimble) → [SwiftTesting](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swift-testing/)
    - [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift) → [Combine](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine)
2. Added support for ping, pong, and empty event transmission.
3. Implemented support for async/await functionality.

The newly developed open-source library is named socketcluster-client-swift-native.

### 🙋🏻‍♂️ Additional Information

1. Compiled a list of frequently used applications and services to set up when configuring a new Mac, for future reference.
