### 🛣️ Summary of Korean-related terms to know in the map domain service

---

When working on address or map-related services, there are various terms such as road name address, administrative district, and legal district. I thought it would be good to organize them again.

> Address System
> 

Addresses are mainly divided into two forms, each with different structures and use cases.

1. Lot number address: `City/Province` + `County/District` + `Town/Township/District` + `Lot number`
- An address system based on the unique number of the land
- Administrative units divided into legal districts and administrative districts
    - Legal district: A district defined by law (an administrative unit defined by law)
        - Mainly used in places related to ID cards, credit cards, and property rights
    - Administrative district: An administrative unit set for administrative efficiency and resident convenience
        - Mainly used in administrative processing
    - ex)
        - Banpo-dong (legal district) → Banpo-bon-dong, Banpo 1~4-dong (administrative district)
        - Sajik-dong, Tongui-dong, Jeokseon-dong, Chebu-dong, etc. 12 (legal districts) → Sajik-dong (administrative district)

2. Road name address: `City/Province` + `County/District` + `Road name` + `Building number` + `Detailed address`

- Introduced in 2014, it is based on roads and building numbers, making it easy to understand and convey.

> Technical Terms Related to Address
> 

1. Geocoding: A technology that converts text-form addresses (lot number address or road name address) into latitude and longitude coordinates

- ex) Used to display a specific location on a map or guide a route

2. Reverse Geocoding: A technology that receives latitude and longitude coordinates and returns the corresponding lot number address or road name address

- ex) Providing a specific location in address form

> Other Terms Related to Map Services
> 
1. Entrance point: The main entrance coordinates of a building or facility
- ex) Navigation guidance, setting delivery destination
1. Center point: The central coordinates of a specific area (building, zone, etc.)
- ex) Area-based search, displaying the center point on a map

### 🙋🏻‍♂️ Other Notes

1. I tried using App Distribution, one of the services provided by Firebase. Since iOS has TestFlight, I thought about when it would be good to use it and concluded that it would be useful when you don't have an Apple paid membership.
