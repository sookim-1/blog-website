### ✅ Writing async & await API Code

---

To try out Swift Testing, I first wrote the code responsible for external API networking.

I structured it as a networking module that takes a request model and returns only the response model, making it reusable.

1. The `RequestModel` provides the URL string, query parameters, headers, HTTP method type, request body, and the type to decode.
2. The response is a decoded model.

I separated it into a package, and since there was no need to upload it remotely, I developed it as a local package.

1. `$ swift package init --name <ProjectName> --type <TypeName>`
2. Added the path in `Tuist Project.swift`

The biggest impression I got from using test code is that you can run the package on a Mac or execute `$ swift test` in the terminal without having to build the entire app. This lets you verify if the response values are correct, making testing incredibly fast.

### 🌎 WebView

---

I referred to blog posts by [@whitelips](https://whitelips.medium.com/) on Medium, where WebView-related content is well organized.

A WebView is a **web browser embedded in a native app.**

On iOS, there are three ways to implement WebView: `UIWebView`, `WKWebView`, and `SFSafariViewController`. `UIWebView` cannot be used on iOS 12 and later. `SFSafariViewController` allows displaying web content through the Safari browser, and `WKWebView` is generally used.

The articles explain WKWebView’s cookie management, timeouts, multi-process architecture, strong references, and more, based on the [WebKit open-source code](https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit), which is highly recommended.

### ❎ UIApplication.shared.open Method Failure

---

Starting from iOS 18, there is an issue where the [UIApplication.shared.open](http://UIApplication.shared.open) method does not get called. If you check the console at the time of failure, you’ll see the error: `BUG IN CLIENT OF UIKIT: The caller of UIApplication.openURL(:) needs to migrate to the non-deprecated UIApplication.open(:options:completionHandler:). Force returning false (NO).`

It appears that this issue is under discussion in the Apple Developer Forum.

- [Forum discussion](https://forums.developer.apple.com/forums/thread/763568)

🅾️ : `UIApplication.shared.open(urlString, options: [:], completionHandler: nil)`

❎ : `UIApplication.shared.open(urlString)`

From now on, you need to be careful with the parameters when using the open method.

### 🙋🏻‍♂️ Other Notes

---

1. In the Facebook (Meta) developer review, make sure to verify that Debug mode works, though it’s unclear how they tested Debug mode.
2. I initially used Tistory for my development blog, but due to issues such as Google Search Console not working properly for indexing, I migrated the blog to Medium.
    - The first post is: [How iOS Developers Should Handle JSON]([https://medium.com/@sookim-1/ios-개발자가-알아야-할-json-처리-방법-150713f9f431](https://medium.com/@sookim-1/ios-%EA%B0%9C%EB%B0%9C%EC%9E%90%EA%B0%80-%EC%95%8C%EC%95%84%EC%95%BC-%ED%95%A0-json-%EC%B2%98%EB%A6%AC-%EB%B0%A9%EB%B2%95-150713f9f431))
3. I reviewed the possibility of adding a Flutter module to an existing iOS app.
    - You can check it out by navigating to the [flutter-add-to-app](https://github.com/flutter-korea/flutter-add-to-app) repository and running `$ flutter pub get` in the Flutter module you want to add.
