### 👁️ Real-Time Text Recognition

---

If you want to recognize text in real-time, iOS provides frameworks like Vision and VisionKit.

Depending on the iOS version, there are several implementation methods:

> **iOS 16 and above**
> 
1. Using `VNDocumentCameraViewController` → Custom UI is difficult to implement due to its limitations.
2. Using `DataScannerViewController` → Offers various options with LiveText (e.g., phone numbers, emails, URLs, etc.).

> **iOS 16 and below**
> 
1. Using `AVFoundation` + `Vision` → Combines image capture and video processing from AVFoundation with text recognition using Vision.

After implementing these methods, I found that LiveText is advantageous for its ability to highlight recognized text and for its simplicity. On the other hand, the AVFoundation + Vision approach is faster and compatible with lower OS versions.

### 🙋🏻‍♂️ Miscellaneous Notes

---

1. When using Local Packages with Tuist, running Fastlane's `increment_build_number` lane requires resetting the package cache every time. I have yet to find a solution for this issue.
2. `git cherry-pick` is useful for applying specific commits, but it has a high risk of conflicts. Thus, using it on the `main` branch requires extra caution.
3. I wrote a blog post about the open-source project **SocketClusterNative**.
