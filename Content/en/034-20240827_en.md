### 🎨 Organizing Swifter for SwiftUI

---

- 🔗 [Swifter for SwiftUI](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/swifter-for-swiftui/id1621133381?l=ko)

I reviewed the Swifter for SwiftUI app, which organizes explanations, basic usage, and tips for SwiftUI components while developing with SwiftUI.

I needed to make a paid subscription to access all content and organized it after the purchase. There were some parts not aligned with the OS updates, but overall, I was satisfied.

After the organization, I applied SwiftUI to this side project.

Since I often use SwiftUI and the TCA architecture, I looked for links related to TCA.

### 🔐 Supabase Auth

---

I decided to apply Supabase, which is emerging as a competitor to Firebase, in my side project.

I previously implemented login functionality using FirebaseAuth + SwiftUI, and the changes involved mainly switching instances; the methods remained almost identical.

A notable feature of Supabase Auth is its Kakao authentication, which I found interesting.

In my side project, I implemented email signup, login, and logout functionalities.

### 📃 Writing about SwiftPM

---

🔗 [SwiftPM - SwiftPackage](https://sookim-1.tistory.com/entry/iOS-SwiftPM-SwiftPackage-1)

I wrote about how to create Swift Packages and SwiftPM, along with a brief structure description.

🔗 [SwiftPM - PackageCollection](https://sookim-1.tistory.com/entry/SwiftPM-PackageCollection)

I wrote about creating PackageCollections for easy addition of package lists and how to add signatures.

Although WWDC videos explain how to use PackageCollections very well, they lack details on how to add signatures, so I elaborated on that.

After organizing this content, I privately distributed a SwiftPackage in the DesignSystem I’m currently using.

### 🙋🏻‍♂️ Other Notes

---

1. I added comments to my 🔗 [Snippet for .gitignore](https://gist.github.com/sookim-1/a3f22fa6c8bee5120e4ecdf663f81f36) to make it easier to read.
2. It seems that changing the camera permission among the iOS app's access permissions causes the app to refresh. (I need to check other permissions as well.) Additionally, even if permission has been requested once, sometimes in TestFlight, the app will still download with the 🔗 [AuthorizationStatus](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocationmanager/authorizationstatus-swift.property) showing as notDetermined.
3. I reviewed an issue in Firebase Crashlytics related to `objc_retain`, which occurs when accessing a Zombie object. It crashes when accessing an object that has been deallocated. I heard it can be checked using Xcode Instruments, but I need to explore it further.
4. I considered how to use Github Actions from the perspective of an iOS app developer.
