### ✅ Swift Testing

---

Starting from Swift 6, a convenient Swift Testing framework has been introduced for testing code.

To explore its capabilities, I migrated my existing test code, which was written using the XCTest framework, to Swift Testing.

> Key features applied:
> 
1. All assertion functions for checking result values have been unified under the `#expect` macro, making them clearer and easier to use.
2. When using the `async` and `await` syntax for networking code, there’s no need for the old wait-time configurations.
3. Simply adding `@Test` to a test function makes it recognizable as a test, and it allows passing multiple arguments as an array, along with various other options.

Apple also provides the 🔗 [Migrating a test from XCTest](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/migratingfromxctest) guide, and since Swift Testing is the default UnitTest framework when creating a new project, it seems recommended to use it.

### 🌎 async ~ await

---

I reviewed the `async` and `await` syntax, one of the Swift Concurrency features introduced in Swift 5.5.

Traditionally, asynchronous code could be written using completion handlers, `DispatchQueue`, RxSwift, Combine, etc. The `async` and `await` syntax helps write asynchronous code in a synchronous-like manner.

> Benefits of using async & await:
> 
1. Improved readability – Since the asynchronous code is written as if it's synchronous, it avoids callback hell.
2. Easier error handling – When used with the `throw` keyword, error handling becomes simpler.
3. Prevents mistakes – It prevents the common mistake of forgetting to call the completion handler.
4. Easier testing – It works seamlessly with Swift Testing, making it easier to write test code.

### 🙋🏻‍♂️ Other Notes

---

1. Tip: It’s crucial to monitor the costs of development services (e.g., reasons for being charged for unused services, cost breakdowns, history, etc.).
2. I have a basic diary app on iOS, but it doesn't have a sharing function, so I should try to implement an app that can be shared with SwiftUI.
