### ⚙️ Tuist

---

To apply Tuist to an existing project, files like `Info.plist` and `xcconfig` need to be prepared if there are any custom values different from the default settings.

I made it easier to extract the `Info.plist` by setting **Xcode Target** -> **Build Settings** -> **Generate info.plist File** to **No**, then manually moved the key-value pairs from the Info tab to the `Info.plist` in Xcode's Navigator panel.

Commands to extract build settings:

```bash
# Extract target build settings.
$ tuist migration settings-to-xcconfig -p Project.xcodeproj -t MyApp -x MyApp.xcconfig

# Extract project build settings.
$ tuist migration settings-to-xcconfig -p Project.xcodeproj -x MyAppProject.xcconfig
```

Using the extracted configurations, I created the `xcconfig` files.

- After adding `*.xcodeproj`, `*.xcworkspace`, and `Derived/` to `.gitignore`, I wrote the `Project.swift` file.
- In Tuist projects, the `Sources` and `Resources` parameters are automatically mapped to **Compile Sources** and **Copy Bundle Resources**, respectively. If the project files are not well-organized, wildcard patterns can be used to simplify things.
- When deleting files, untracked files that no longer appear in Xcode Navigator must be excluded or removed.
- When writing a Target Script, you can either write the script directly or link to a script file. Each method has its pros and cons. Writing directly allows immediate viewing in Xcode, but changes may not apply correctly.
    - If using **Swift Package Plugin - Build Tool Plugin**, the plugin can be added to the dependency parameter of the Tuist target.

If your project is composed entirely of Swift files and does not rely on dependency managers like CocoaPods or Carthage, applying Tuist can be done smoothly.

Interestingly, the proportion of Tuist-related blog posts is much higher in Korea than overseas. Many of these posts customize Tuist object initialization methods to avoid writing redundant code, which is helpful. However, it can be inconvenient to identify what changes were made within the methods. It's essential to choose the right approach depending on the situation.
