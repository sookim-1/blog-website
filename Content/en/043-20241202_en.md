### 🔥 Created iOSDevExample Project

---

While storing Xcode example projects on GitHub, I found it inefficient to create a separate repository for each project, as it resulted in numerous repositories and posed management challenges.

To address this, I created a remote repository to manage these example projects using Tuist, anticipating that it would simplify management and make it easier to handle reusable modules.

Using Tuist's Workspace made managing multiple projects more convenient.

Each project operates entirely independently (e.g., resources, code, targets, etc.).

Compared to organizing Xcode example projects into separate folders, Tuist eliminates the need to run each project individually and allows for easier management of shared modules.

This time, I added an example project that recognizes text through the camera. Moving forward, I plan to keep adding example projects to this repository.

### 🙋🏻‍♂️ Additional Notes

---

1. The `exit 0` code used to force terminate iOS apps now seems to restart the app instead of terminating it. I'll need to investigate if there have been any changes.
2. Since Cursor AI is a fork of VSCode, I explored VSCode in detail. Learning that VSCode is a code editor and understanding how to use it effectively made using Cursor much easier.
3. A Danggeun Meetup was recently held, and I was particularly interested in the session discussing how the "Local Life" tab operates entirely via WebView.
4. Recently, `전라북도` was renamed to `전북특별자치도` In location-based services, it's crucial to stay updated on such changes.
