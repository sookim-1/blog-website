### 📱 Modern CollectionView
---

Using UICollectionView is convenient for displaying repetitive data, and many new APIs have been added in iOS 14 and later, so I organized and experimented with them all.

- UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource
- UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout
- UICollectionView.CellRegistration
- UIContentConfiguration

With the above additions, I compared the previously used methods (for iOS 14 and earlier) by writing the code and then applying the new APIs to analyze the differences.

### 👨🏻‍💻 Organizing Remote Repositories and Blog
---

I felt the need to update my GitHub profile page, which still states that I am studying iOS.

So, I removed the profile repository and pinned the repositories and gists that I frequently check or want to display.

While writing on Tistory, I thought it would be nice to have a floating table of contents on the side, so I looked into it. Tistory offers various skins, some of which provide multiple features, and I can also add desired features through the HTML editor.

I explored different skins and found that adding a table of contents feature to the default skin was the most appealing option.

I also requested reindexing in Google Search Console and Naver Webmaster Tools once again.

### 🙋🏻‍♂️ Other Notes

1. When writing frequently used code, you can utilize Xcode's Snippet feature. To use it on other computers, I created my own snippet in a gist: [My Snippet](https://gist.github.com/sookim-1/04552ce57b1e154a165121c5f064637f).
