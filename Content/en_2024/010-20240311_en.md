### 🔄 FCM Token Renewal
---
When using Firebase projects separated by Debug and Release, managing the FCM Token is important. If the build environment is installed in Debug mode and the app is reinstalled in Release mode, the FCM Token may change.

The FCM Token value changes in the following four cases:

- Restoring the app on a new device
- The user removes/reinstalls the app
- The user clears app data
- The app deletes the instance ID

To manually renew the FCM, it can be done by deleting and then fetching the token. Below is the code for directly renewing the FCM token, where deletion is optional.

### 📱 CollectionView Compositional Layout
---
For displaying repetitive data and future scalability, CollectionView Compositional Layout can be used. When using CollectionView Compositional Layout, both the basic UICollectionViewDataSource and UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource can be utilized. When implementing headers and footers for each section using UICollectionReusableView, care must be taken in the viewForSupplementaryElementOfKind method, as it may be reused.

### 🚀 Build Time Increase Issue When Using FireStore
---
I confirmed the reason for the exponentially increased build time in the project using FireStore two weeks ago, and it is indeed confirmed that using FireStore significantly increases the build time. To reduce the build time, I found that FireStore consists of many C++ files, which can increase compilation time when built with Xcode, as noted in the ReadMe of the [FireStore iOS SDK repository](https://github.com/invertase/firestore-ios-sdk-frameworks).

- The original pod installation command was `pod 'FirebaseFirestore', '10.19.0'`.
- The modified pod installation command is `pod 'FirebaseFirestore', :git => '<https://github.com/invertase/firestore-ios-sdk-frameworks.git>', :tag => '10.19.0'`.

The build time was reduced to a level similar to before switching to FireStore. In other words, it was changed to use precompiled binary files for FireStore.

### 🙋🏻‍♂️ Other Notes
---
1. I am deploying a GitHub blog using the Publish library with the Swift language, but there was an issue where using certain emojis in the markdown syntax caused the deployment workflow to fail, so I corrected that part.
