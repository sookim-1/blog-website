### ‚úÖ Throttle Event Duplicate Processing Issue

---

When issues occur only in different Build Configurations, I examined the differences for each Build Configuration. One of the differences is the API response speed, which is faster in the Release environment.

When clicking a button, after making an API request and successfully receiving a response, the screen transitions occur. To prevent duplicate touches, I implemented Throttle handling. In the Debug environment, the API response speed was slower than the Live version, so setting it to 1 second did not cause any issues. However, in the Release environment, due to the faster API response speed, an event was triggered again before the API response arrived, leading to a memory accumulation issue on the screen.

I modified the API request to occur on the next screen and added indicator handling to resolve the issue, but I need to further analyze the precautions when using Throttle together with API requests.

1. By changing `ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_APPICON_NAME` in the build settings for each target, the app icon name can be modified without using the default name "AppIcon."
