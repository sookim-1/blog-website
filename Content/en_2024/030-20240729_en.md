### ⚙️ CocoaPod Organization
---

Last week, I organized the method for deploying a private CocoaPod repository, and during this process, I compiled additional details about CocoaPods, which I documented step-by-step on my Tistory blog.

I covered basic explanations about CocoaPods, various errors encountered while using CocoaPods, frequently used commands, and how to create and deploy libraries, both publicly and privately.

### 🙋🏻‍♂️ Other Notes
---

1. I began consolidating duplicate pages in my personal Notion iOS development database and restructuring it into a single, more searchable DB. This task is about 60% complete.
2. An issue occurred on a screen that shifts the view according to the keyboard's height. This issue arose after updating the IQKeyboardManager library to version 7.0.3, so I disabled IQKeyboardManager for that specific screen.
