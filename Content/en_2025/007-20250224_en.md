### üôà Hiding UINavigationBar

---

In an iOS app, screens can be transitioned using `UINavigationController`.

When hiding the navigation bar during a screen transition in the view controller lifecycle, there are some important considerations.

For example, if transitioning from screen A ‚Üí screen B via `push`, and the navigation bar is re-enabled in `viewDidDisappear` of screen A while being hidden in `viewWillAppear` of screen B, the navigation bar will **not** be hidden on screen B.

This happens because `viewWillAppear` of screen B is called **before** `viewDidDisappear` of screen A.

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Flutter Login Flow Porting

---

I worked on a project where the pre-login flow in an existing iOS project was ported to Flutter, while the post-login flow remained in native code, connected via Flutter's Method Channel.

Here are my key takeaways from the Flutter porting experience:

1. Development productivity is high due to features like **Hot Reload** and multi-platform implementation.
2. Communication between Flutter and native code was relatively stable.
3. There are slight differences in **fonts, colors, and dialogs** between Flutter and native implementations.
4. **Initial build times** are long, and the **app size** tends to increase significantly.

Important points to keep in mind when integrating native code:

1. If using `SceneDelegate`, additional configurations are needed in the default generated project.
2. Build configurations are divided into **Debug, Profile, and Release**, and preprocessor flags are not automatically set. Flags should be configured in **Build Settings ‚Üí Active Compilation Conditions** if needed.
3. On devices running **iOS 14 and above**, apps cannot be launched in Debug mode directly (except when launched from the IDE).

### üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Other Notes

1. When using the [`open`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplication/open(_:options:completionhandler:)) method to open a URL link, it must run on the **main thread** to prevent delays or freezes when returning to the app.
