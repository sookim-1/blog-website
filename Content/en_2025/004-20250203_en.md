### ‚ö°Ô∏è Concurrency Programming

---

I conducted several tests to utilize GCD more effectively.

**First**, I modified a code snippet that applies a gradient border to a view using `CAGradientLayer`. By moving the object creation and adjustments to a Global queue, I was able to reduce the execution time from approximately `0.004 seconds` to `0.001 seconds`.

**Second**, I optimized multiple API calls in the splash screen using `DispatchGroup`, allowing concurrent execution. As a result, the total execution time was reduced from approximately `1.4 seconds` to `0.4 seconds`.

**Takeaway**: Concurrency programming proves to be particularly beneficial in tasks such as loading multiple images or handling multiple API requests simultaneously.

1. Useful public portal sites:  
    - [Mongttang Information Key](https://umppa.seoul.go.kr/hmpg/main.do)  
    - [Share Nuri](https://www.eshare.go.kr/UserPortal/Upm/Main/index.do)  
2. A HeatMap is a visualization technique that represents data density or magnitude using colors. A GeoHeatMap is a form of a heatmap applied to a map.  
3. I explored features in Figma, a tool commonly used when collaborating with designers. Learning about Components, Widgets, and Auto Layout in Figma can greatly enhance communication and UI development.

4. I watched SwiftUI tutorials on the [KavSoft](https://www.youtube.com/Kavsoft) YouTube channel and created a GitHub repository while binge-watching lessons 1 to 20.
