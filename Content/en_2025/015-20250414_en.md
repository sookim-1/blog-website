### üëâ Flutter Pilot App Development

---

I was in charge of developing a simple journey flow using Flutter for a mobility service and completed the development and testing phase.

What I felt during development:
1. Flutter seems to have a high dependency on packages. (Therefore, when using multiple packages, you need to consider issues such as version conflicts or unsupported packages.)
2. Development productivity is high. (Hot Reload and Hot Restart allow you to instantly check your code, and the declarative UI style is convenient.)
3. Although there are some unstable aspects such as memory management and background communication, overall, it worked well.

### üßÆ Efficient and Stable iOS Code Architecture: Functional & Declarative Programming Paradigm - Session 3

---

I started attending a 5-week offline course hosted by FastCampus on efficient and stable iOS code architecture. The course focuses on functional and declarative programming paradigms.

**Summary of Session 3**

- Declarative architecture declares *what* should be done, and delegates *how* it is performed to the system in an automated manner.
- Comparison of programming styles:
	- Imperative: procedural, object-oriented (command-focused)
	- Declarative: functional, logical (intent-focused)

### ‚õìÔ∏è MCP

---

MCP (Model Context Protocol) has been gaining attention recently, so I looked into it. MCP is a standardized communication protocol that allows AI models to be easily integrated into various applications.

It was developed by [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/), the company behind the Claude model, and is described in detail at [this link](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/mcp).  
Although it was introduced a while ago, it has recently gained popularity as it became integrated with tools like Cursor and the Claude app.

Since MCP is a standard communication protocol, various MCPs exist. You can browse available MCPs using MCP marketplaces.

Among the many MCPs, I tried using GitHub MCP and Figma MCP via Cursor.

- With GitHub MCP, I was able to register issues and create pull requests directly through chat in Cursor, which was very convenient.
- For Figma MCP, I tried both Figma-Context-MCP and cursor-talk-to-figma-mcp. I could either design directly in Figma or convert frames in Figma to code. The conversion quality was far better than the results from providing just images.

Additionally, you can configure appropriate Cursor rules to achieve even better results.
