### 💻 Managing Mac Storage

---

When using a Mac, system data or build files can grow significantly and cause storage issues. Here's a quick summary of how to free up space:

1. If you're using Xcode, go to Storage → Developer section and clean the following:
   - **Project build data and index**
   - **Project archives** (space taken up by app packages)
   - **iOS Device Support** (installed files for each iOS version used for real device testing)
2. Go to Storage → Applications and delete unused apps.
3. Go to Storage → Documents and remove unused files.
4. Go to Storage → System Data and clean up manually:
   - Use the command `$ sudo du -sh -h *` in each directory to check size.
   - Delete unused items under `~/Library/Application Support`
   - Delete unused items under `~/Library/Caches`
   - Delete unused items under `~/Library/Containers`
   - Check `~/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator`  
     - If this takes up too much space, go to Xcode → Settings → Components and delete "Other Installed Platforms".

### 📃 DocC

---

DocC is Apple’s official documentation tool that lets you write documents using Markdown-based syntax.

DocC supports different formats such as Articles, API documentation (styled similarly to Apple’s official docs), and Tutorials.

Among these, the **Tutorial format** is especially interesting. I plan to use it for creating course materials in an upcoming lecture I'm preparing.

### 🙋🏻‍♂️ Other Notes

---

1. Naver Maps API is gradually transitioning out of the AI NAVER API product group starting next month. If you continue to use the Maps API through the AI NAVER API section, it will no longer be free.  
   - You need to switch over to the new Maps product.  
   - The authentication method changes slightly: you must use SDK version **3.21.0 or higher**, and set `clientId` to `ncpKeyId`.

2. As a hobby, I've started experimenting with web crawling using Python:
   - I installed Anaconda and practiced using Selenium for web scraping.
