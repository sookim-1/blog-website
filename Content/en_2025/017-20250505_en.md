### üçé Tips for Implementing Apple Login

---

**Hide My Email**

Apple Login provides a feature called "Hide My Email," which allows users to log in without revealing their actual email address by generating a random one.

When signing up using this feature, the email will have the domain `@privaterelay.appleid.com`.

Emails sent to this generated address cannot be received by default.

However, if you're using an iCloud+ subscription, you can still send and receive emails while using the "Hide My Email" feature.

**Receiving Data**

Apple Login only provides user data such as email and name on the first login attempt. After that, only the token is provided.

You can view the services connected via Apple Login by going to iPhone Settings ‚Üí Your Name ‚Üí Sign in with Apple.  
If you delete the connected app and try again, you will receive the email and name data again.

Note: If you sign up again using "Hide My Email" after deletion, the same email address will be used as before.

1. [Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/usage) is a service that makes web crawling very simple. When connected with MCP, it can even process web data.
2. Cursor is a tool forked from VSCode that integrates AI features. I tried using **Cline**, which is a similar VSCode extension that leverages AI, along with MCP. If you're already using VSCode and prefer to use extensions rather than switching tools, Cline could be a good alternative to Cursor.
3. When handling legal district addresses in Korea, they're usually written with `~dong`, but you may also encounter variations like `~ga`, `~ro`, etc. It's best to verify the exact address format using official lookup services.
    a. e.g., Sejong-ro, Jongno 3-ga  
    b. [Legal District Lookup](https://land.seoul.go.kr:444/land/klis/findHjdongAddress.do)  
    c. [Road Name Address Lookup](https://www.juso.go.kr/openIndexPage.do)
