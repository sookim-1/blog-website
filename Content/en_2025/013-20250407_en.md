### üëâ¬†Flutter - Trippo Uber Clone Project

---

I was assigned to develop a simple journey flow for a mobility service using Flutter. I found the [Trippo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBXKBvCSAMI&list=PL2OW6kiTqhAw2e9YlaxHzK0j8UWoswgJF&index=1) Uber clone project course, which helped guide the overall project direction.

- This Flutter course covered building both user and driver apps using Google Maps and Google APIs such as Firebase Realtime Database and FCM.
- Some legacy code exists and requires manual updates.
	- For instance, FCM API calls are made using the deprecated legacy method, which needs to be migrated to HTTP v1 for proper functionality.
	- Google Roads API does not support route search when configured for the Korea region.

### üë®‚Äçüéì¬†Inflearn Knowledge Sharing Challenge - Session 2

---

Inflearn refers to course creators as ‚Äúknowledge sharers.‚Äù Creating a course is considered ‚Äúsharing knowledge,‚Äù and a new support program called the Knowledge Sharing Challenge (1st batch) has opened. I joined the challenge to create an introductory iOS app development course.

In the second session, I learned how to structure a course curriculum. One of the most helpful strategies is to reference the curricula of popular or similar-topic courses. Creating a mind map also helps with organizing the course content.

### üßÆ¬†Efficient and Reliable iOS Code Design: Functional & Declarative Programming Paradigms - Session 2

---

I began attending an offline course hosted by FastCampus titled *Efficient and Reliable iOS Code Design*, which runs for five weeks. This course focuses on functional and declarative programming paradigms. - [Course Intro Link](https://fastcampus.co.kr/dev_camp_functional)

**Summary of Session 2**

Functional Programming Data Structures:
- **Functor**: A data structure that allows value transformation.
- **Monad**: A structure that allows transformations of both the context and the value.
- **Either**: Represents data with two possible states (e.g., success/failure).
- **Option / Maybe**: Encapsulates the presence or absence of a value via context.

Functional Programming Patterns:
- **Currying**: Divides a function to take one argument at a time.
- **Partial Application**: Creates a new function by fixing some of the parameters.
- **Point-free Style**: Omits function arguments to improve readability by focusing on function composition.

1. I looked into how Kakao T utilizes AI. AI is applied to optimize driver-passenger matching, improving the likelihood of ride acceptance.
