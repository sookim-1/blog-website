### üì± Resolution Units Summary

---

While developing with Flutter, I briefly reviewed resolution differences by OS to determine whether the UI differences between Android and iOS are due to OS-level resolution systems.

- **Resolution**: The total number of pixels displayed on the screen.
- **Pixel Density (ppi, pixels per inch)**: A key factor that determines screen sharpness ‚Äî the number of pixels per inch.
- **Device Pixel Ratio (DPR)**

**Unit systems in Android and iOS**

> Android: DP (dots per inch)

| Size     | dpi     | Pixel         | Scale |
| -------- | ------- | ------------- | ----- |
| ldpi     | ~120dpi | 240 x 320     | 0.75x |
| mdpi     | ~160dpi | 360 x 480     | 1x    |
| hdpi     | ~240dpi | 480 x 800     | 1.5x  |
| xhdpi    | ~320dpi | 720 x 1280    | 2.0x  |
| xxhdpi   | ~480dpi | 1080 x 1920   | 3.0x  |
| xxxhdpi  | ~640dpi | 1440 x 2560   | 4.0x  |



> iOS: PT (points)

| Scale |
| ----- |
| 1.0x  |
| 2.0x  |
| 3.0x  |

### üßÆ Efficient and Stable iOS Code Architecture: Functional & Declarative Programming Paradigms - Session 4

---

I began attending a 5-week offline course hosted by FastCampus titled *Efficient and Stable iOS Code Architecture*. The topic of the course is functional & declarative programming. - [Course Introduction Link](https://fastcampus.co.kr/dev_camp_functional)

**Summary of Session 4**

- Based on the `MVVM` architecture, values from network or data layers are processed in the `ViewModel` using immutability and pure functions.
- Complex business logic is separated in a functional style to ensure **predictable state** and **ease of testing**.

### üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Other Notes

---
1. Sites to check the tech stack used by different companies:
   - [StackShare](https://stackshare.io/)
   - [Codenary](https://www.codenary.co.kr/)
2. A site with well-written AI explanations in Korean:  
   - [apidog Blog](https://apidog.com/api-design)
3. Recently, "vibe coding" is gaining traction. I used the Figma MCP + Cursor combo to build a React project from a simple image-and-text-based website. After a few tweaks, it successfully met the basic requirements.
