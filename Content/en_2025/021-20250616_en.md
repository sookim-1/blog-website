### ‚ö°Ô∏è Swift Concurrency Parallel Programming Comparison

---

When making networking requests that don't need to be executed sequentially, making them in parallel can reduce the overall time. Previously, we used `DispatchGroup`, adding tasks with `enter`, and signaling completion with `leave`, then handling everything in `notify` once all were complete.

**DispatchGroup Parallel Code**
```swift
func requestLegacyParallel() {
    let group = DispatchGroup()
    var results = [Bool]()
    let startTime = Date()
    print("Start (DispatchGroup)")

    for _ in 0..<3 {
        group.enter()
        Task {
            let result = await self.networking()
            results.append(result)
            group.leave()
        }
    }

    group.notify(queue: .main) {
        let endTime = Date()
        let duration = endTime.timeIntervalSince(startTime)
        print("End (DispatchGroup): Duration \(duration) seconds")
        print("Results: \(results)")
    }
}
```


**Swift Concurrency Sequential Code Example**
```swift
func requestConcurrency() {
    Task {
        let startTime = Date()
        print("Start (Sequential)")

        let a1 = await self.networking()
        let a2 = await self.networking()
        let a3 = await self.networking()

        let result = [a1, a2, a3]
        let endTime = Date()
        let duration = endTime.timeIntervalSince(startTime)
        print("End: Duration \(duration) seconds")
        print("Results: \(results)")
    }
}
```


**Swift Concurrency Parallel Code Example**
```swift
func requestConcurrencyParallel() {
    Task {
        let startTime = Date()
        print("Start (Parallel)")

        async let a1 = self.networking()
        async let a2 = self.networking()
        async let a3 = self.networking()

        let results = await (a1, a2, a3)

        let endTime = Date()
        let duration = endTime.timeIntervalSince(startTime)
        print("End (Parallel): Duration \(duration) seconds")
        print("Results: \(results)")
    }
}
```


When comparing the elapsed time, both the DispatchGroup and `async let` approaches naturally result in faster execution compared to sequential requests. Since Apple recommends using Concurrency, we should use `async let` for parallel execution.

### üìÉ¬†SQL Query Syntax

---

I spent some time reviewing SQL query syntax.

There were some confusing parts regarding aggregate functions in the SELECT statement, but understanding that multiple datasets are merged into a single dataset helped clarify the concept.

Even if you combine multiple tables, the result is always a single table.

Keywords: SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, JOIN ~ ON, LEFT JOIN ~ ON, Count(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX()

### üìù¬†Obsidian

---

Obsidian is an app used to write and manage notes using markdown syntax. Initially, I thought I could only use it locally or with a paid sync option, but after doing some research, I found that remote sync can be set up for free using various cloud services like GitHub, Dropbox, and Google Drive.

First, I completely removed my previous Obsidian setup.

**How to Completely Remove It**
```bash
# Search the entire system starting from root
# -iname "*obsidian*" searches for files/folders containing "obsidian", case-insensitive
# 2>/dev/null suppresses permission error messages
$ sudo find / -iname "*obsidian*" 2>/dev/null

# -iname "obs*" searches for names starting with "obs", case-insensitive
$ sudo find / -iname "*obs*" 2>/dev/null
```


I then integrated GitHub using the Git plugin, and Dropbox using the Remotely Save plugin.

Although the paid Obsidian Sync is more stable and setting up plugins each time is a bit of a hassle, I‚Äôll reconsider the paid option once I become more familiar with Obsidian.

On a side note, I noticed that the cache size on my Mac seemed to be increasing, so I plan to look into that further.

### üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Other Notes

---

1. At WWDC 2025, Apple introduced Liquid Glass support starting with iOS 26. They also released an app called IconComposer, which makes it easier to create app icons. I gave it a try.
2. I'm planning to develop an image loader that supports E-Tag, which can be applied to image URLs and web URLs.
3. I tried running an AI video generation tool called FramePack on my M1 Max. RAM is important, but GPU performance also matters a lot. Since generating results took a long time, I looked into alternatives and found that using Hugging Face Spaces to run it remotely is also a good option.
