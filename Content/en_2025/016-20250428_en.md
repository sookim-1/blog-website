### üë®‚Äçüéì Inflearn Knowledge Sharing Challenge - Session 3

---

Inflearn defines course creators as "knowledge sharers." Creating a course is considered an act of knowledge sharing, and the first batch of the Knowledge Sharing Challenge, which supports course creation, has opened. I decided to join this challenge to create an introductory course on iOS app development.

- [Knowledge Sharing Challenge Intro](https://www.inflearn.com/course/offline/%EC%9D%B8%ED%94%84%EB%9F%B0-%EC%A7%80%EC%8B%9D%EA%B3%B5%EC%9C%A0-%EC%B1%8C%EB%A6%B0%EC%A7%80-1%EA%B8%B0?srsltid=AfmBOoq6-MKgLli_n34B5TnLgtqeoGRwitZ87hjsd9sTjTrB9b4aahhc%3E)

In this third session, I shared tips for filming course videos.


### üßÆ Efficient and Stable iOS Code Design: Functional & Declarative Programming Paradigm - Session 5

---

I participated in a 5-week offline course by FastCampus on efficient and stable iOS code design. The course focused on functional and declarative programming paradigms.

**Summary of Session 5**

This session demonstrated how to apply functional programming in simple demo apps like a calculator app or a book search app using the Google Books API.  
As it was the final session, the instructor shared insights on team collaboration and how functional programming is used in real service domains.  
To wrap up, we learned that while functional programming may not always be feasible due to various collaboration styles or environments, adopting a functional mindset alone can be a huge benefit.

### üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Other Notes

1. I explored NativeScript, a library that allows native mobile apps to be developed using multiple frameworks. It seems cross-platform technologies continue to evolve.
