### üçé Checking App Store Update Versions

---

[Reference](https://woozoobro.medium.com/app-store-%EC%97%85%EB%8D%B0%EC%9D%B4%ED%8A%B8-%EB%B2%84%EC%A0%84-%EC%B2%B4%ED%81%AC-9c987d43c0d4)

While distributing an app on the App Store, I looked into the [iTunes Search API](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/iTuneSearchAPI/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40017632-CH3-SW1) documentation to check the current App Store version.

There is also a related document on [Apple Partners](https://performance-partners.apple.com/search-api), but it is essentially a summary of the previous document and is nearly identical.

This API allows you to search for relevant content in the iTunes Store and Apple Books Store based on the search field. For example, you can retrieve information about movies, podcasts, music, music videos, audiobooks, and software (apps).

The official documentation does not mention a `bundleId` parameter key, but I found online that you can retrieve software information using `bundleId`.

‚úÖ One new discovery is that searching with `https://itunes.apple.com/lookup?bundleId=\\(bundleID)` returns the version information released on the App Store in JSON format. However, after releasing an app on the App Store, I noticed a slight buffer between the released version and the response version.

Among the parameter keys, `country` specifies the region where the app is available. The default is `US`, but setting it to `KR` (for South Korea) ensured that the App Store version synced correctly.

### üìå Technical Exchange with Developers

---

Recently, I had the opportunity to share development approaches and concepts with server developers, Android developers, and DevOps engineers.

**üí¨ Discussion with Server Developers**

- I was recommended the PARA note-taking method as an effective way to organize what I learn.
- We discussed the importance of maintaining a positive mindset.
- I learned that it is wise to avoid rushing plans or expanding the scope excessively.

**üì± Discussion with Android Developers**

- I understood how Android's UI components, Activity and Fragment, correspond to iOS‚Äôs ViewController and ContainerView.
- We discussed concerns about handling screen transitions when using OneLink and different Fragment states within the same Activity.

**üõ† Discussion with DevOps Engineers**

- I received an explanation of NAS (Network Attached Storage) and related concepts.
- I learned that NAS is a type of storage system where RAID configuration should be considered.
- We compared on-premises and cloud environments, discussing how to choose the most suitable option based on the situation.
- The explanation materials were written in Markdown using Obsidian, making them highly readable.
- I gained insights into analyzing reasonable products and services by referring to Google search trends and Fair Trade Commission data.

1. Android Studio Tips
    1. If an underline appears in the middle of text in the source code, it is due to the use of deprecated code. - [Q&A](https://www.masterqna.com/android/23023/%EC%86%8C%EC%8A%A4-%EA%B8%80%EC%9E%90%EA%B0%80%EC%9A%B4%EB%8D%B0-%EC%A4%91%EA%B0%84-%EC%97%90-%EC%99%9C-%EC%A4%84%EC%9D%B4-%EC%B3%90%EC%A7%80%EB%82%98%EC%9A%94-%E3%85%A0%E3%85%A0%E3%85%A0)
    2. To open multiple projects simultaneously when launching a project, go to File ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Appearance & Behavior ‚Üí System Settings and set the "Open Project in" option to "New Window." - [Blog Guide](https://offbyone.tistory.com/426)
2. While porting to Flutter, I noticed an increase in app size and considered factors to keep in mind when dealing with large app sizes. Users in regions with poor connectivity or those on low-cost data plans might find downloading large apps burdensome.
